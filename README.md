### 1.1. Problem:
Target problem is stressful queues in private medical channeling centers. Experts found patients stress levels and blood pressure rise dangerously high as they become frustrated with the delay in getting through.
Even when we have 15 minutes ride to the channel center we have to go and wait until doctors’ arrival, sometimes it make take more than 1h from the given time by the receptionist. Worst case of this scenario is when we get later numbers and wait until the doctors’ arrival.
Most of the time these channel centers are located near cities where we can fulfill our needs, but as doctors arrival time is not knowing to the patients we cannot leave and comeback.

### 1.2. Solution
My solution is based on simple mechanism where patients can get a notification when doctor arrives to the channel center. This solution consist with simple mobile application (nurse or doctor can press the button when they start channeling).This app will post a twitter update and patients can follow the medical center channel through their ordinary mobile devices.By implementing counting, twitter feeds can send with the current number of the patient.

### 1.3. Technologies
* IFTTT(If This Then That ) Cloud Services to integrate APIs of hardware device and twitter
* Google Auth
